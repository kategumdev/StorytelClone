# StorytelClone

This is a personal non-commercial project (a clone of Storytel app) I created to demonstrate my iOS development skills.

## Description

The original app is designed for reading ebooks and listening to audiobooks. In this clone, I have implemented search functionality using the Google Books API and iTunes API. The books that users save within the app are stored and managed using Core Data for persistence.

## Usage

To run this project from within Xcode:
  * Obtain your personal API KEY for Google Books API.
  * In 'Edit scheme' of your project, choose 'Run' and add environmental property named GOOGLE_BOOKS_API_KEY.
